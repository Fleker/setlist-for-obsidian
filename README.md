# Setlist for Obsidian

This project uses the setlist.fm API to sync the concerts you've attended to a file in Obsidian with date-specific backlinks. This can help you keep track of movies you've seen as well as when you've seen them. It also adds a backlink for the city, if you want to keep track of cities you've been to.

You'll need to bring your own API key.

## Example

You open up the command palette and run the **Sync attended concerts** command. It then fetches data and places it in a file called `Setlist Concerts Attended.md` in a bulleted list.
